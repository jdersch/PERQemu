PERQemu "experiments" branch ChangeBlog


Summary of changes on the development branch since the v0.5.0 release.  Previous
notes moved to ChangeLog-Old.txt.  New entries here will be added at the top, to
avoid wasting precious time scrolling to the end. :-)


March, 2023:

    3. WOO!  Ethernet is now ACTUALLY happening.  Still pretty raw, but packets
    are now flowing: first successful POS FTP transfer, echo test with POS
    diagnostic program "TestEther", and even Accent is sending Speak/Listen and
    Sesame (remote filesystem!) traffic.  Super early, and nowhere close to
    ready for "production", but the basic mechanism works.  So stoked.  Chuffed
    to bits.  Tickled pink.  A little bit giddy, even. :-)

    2. Provide a crude patch to map Turkish characters to UTF-8/ASCIIish so the
    CLI can parse 'i' and 'I' (in their various forms).  In the longer term,
    moving toward more awareness of and better handling of non-US/English input
    locales and (in a future GUI!) possibly even language translations would be
    great, to help spread the PERQ love globally. :-)

    1. Ethernet is kind of happening.  In the first cut, it's a purely low-level
    "raw" interface that runs in promiscuous mode so the PERQ can drive it as
    close to its own view of the hardware as possible.  This is cool, since it
    can run XNS, IPv4, and various undocumented/proprietary protocols and the
    direct packet mashing is relatively easy.  However, it requires elevated
    privileges (root/administrator) and... that ain't great.  In progress.
    

February, 2023:

    5. Real Ethernet support is taking its first baby steps!  It's still fragile
    and needs a ton of debugging.  The older versions of PacketDotNet/SharpPcap
    that work with net48 are rather out of date, but the newer versions (which
    claim to support both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core apparently just lie.
    Mama said there'd be days like this.

    4. Found and fixed an esoteric microcode bug in POS F.15 and rolled that up
    with the GPIB, RSX: fixes into an "Amendment 1" release (posted with a full
    floppy set to the PERQmedia repo).  Updated the bundled f15 and f15dev.prqm
    images in Disks/.

    3. Start adding the framework for Ethernet support.  Bumped version to
    distinguish from the abortive Micropolis effort.

    2. Fixed some small bugs that allowed PNX 2 to install itself and built up
    a Shugart disk image.  However, ICL's interpretation of the video hardware
    programming produces corrupted/inconsistent display.  Once that's debugged
    and a workaround devised, a PNX 2 image will be posted to the PERQmedia
    archive.

    1. Started work on the Micropolis 8" disk driver, attempting to build and
    test support for the "CIO Micropolis" configuration.  Without source code
    to PNX or ICL's POS R.4 modifications -- and no schematics or even a clear
    description of what the "ICL CIO" board or CIOShugart/CIOMicropolis disk
    support ACTUALLY MEANS -- it has proven impossible.  There are several
    different versions of the Micropolis code that are completely at odds with
    the available documentation and the EIO way of doing things; booting from
    floppy produces different results/installs different microcode that makes
    subsequent attempts to boot from the hard drive fail.  It's basically a
    complete disaster.  There's no point in continuing to bash my head on it.
    For now this means the "CIO" board ONLY supports Shugart 14" drives and the
    8" Micropolis will ONLY be supported on the PERQ-2 and PERQ-2/T1 models as
    the EIO board is developed.  If further exploration of the available media
    yields more information about the "CIO Micropolis" interface it can be
    added in later.  Bummer.
