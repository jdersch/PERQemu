PERQemu "experiments" branch ChangeBlog


Summary of changes on the development branch since the v0.5.0 release.  Previous
notes moved to ChangeLog-Old.txt.  New entries here will be added at the top, to
avoid wasting precious time scrolling to the end. :-)


February, 2023:

    2. Fixed some small bugs that allowed PNX 2 to install itself and built up
    a Shugart disk image.  However, ICL's interpretation of the video hardware
    programming produces corrupted/inconsistent display.  Once that's debugged
    and a workaround devised, a PNX 2 image will be posted to the PERQmedia
    archive.

    1. Started work on the Micropolis 8" disk driver, attempting to build and
    test support for the "CIO Micropolis" configuration.  Without source code
    to PNX or ICL's POS R.4 modifications -- and no schematics or even a clear
    description of what the "ICL CIO" board or CIOShugart/CIOMicropolis disk
    support ACTUALLY MEANS -- it has proven impossible.  There are several
    different versions of the Micropolis code that are completely at odds with
    the available documentation and the EIO way of doing things; booting from
    floppy produces different results/installs different microcode that makes
    subsequent attempts to boot from the hard drive fail.  It's basically a
    complete disaster.  There's no point in continuing to bash my head on it.
    For now this means the "CIO" board ONLY supports Shugart 14" drives and the
    8" Micropolis will ONLY be supported on the PERQ-2 and PERQ-2/T1 models as
    the EIO board is developed.  If further exploration of the available media
    yields more information about the "CIO Micropolis" interface it can be
    added in later.  Bummer.
