PERQemu "experiments" branch ChangeBlog

If you don't wait with bated breath for more scintillating prose and/or lunatic
ravings with every Git commit log entry, here's a summary of the significant
changes to the experiments branch since I resumed hacking on it in late 2021.
Newest entries added fresh regularly at the end.


Summary of changes on this branch since October, 2021:

    1. New SDL2 Display.cs has been hacked to allow it to run on Mono under
    macOS.  The Windows version may be able to spawn a separate thread for
    SDL's event loop, but on Mac (and Linux?) this is apparently impossible;
    thus, I've clumsily forced it back onto the main thread.
   
    2. Verified that this version runs on MacOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) AND on
    10.13 (High Sierra).  These are the newest versions I have available
    for testing.  They run in both 32- and 64-bit mode!  The horrible Mac
    keyboard hack is no longer required, which is good since we can't
    support the old Mono 4.6.1 runtime anymore. :-/  Absolutely no idea
    if anything runs on 10.14+, and I haven't tried to fire up the Linux VM
    in quite some time... will get to that when we get closer to wrapping up
    an actual release!

    3. The CPU class has been refactored to include support for the 24-bit
    processor!  Configurator allows up to 8MB (4MW) of memory, and the
    VideoController should properly decode addresses for the >2MB configs.
    Landscape display is supported but can't (yet) be tested until a newer
    OS can boot (requires CIO/EIO for "new" Z80).

    4. Enhancements to the CLI that make it more TOPS-20/Cisco IOS-like,
    with tab-expansion providing matching for enumerated options and more
    in-line help.  There are still some enhancements that Josh folded into
    the old Debugger yet to be incorporated (the ":variable" syntax is
    missing/busted at the moment).

    5. If I could back-port a 64-bit Cocoa WinForms driver (<bashes head
    on desk>) to run on 10.11-10.13, a pretty slick graphical configuration
    tool and front end is already written, but abandoned due to 32-bit app
    support being dropped by Apple.  Sigh.


Updates in November, 2021:

    1. Removed the old Z80 and moved Z80_new into its place.  Started to
    refactor the IO so that different board types can be selected -- the
    EIO for the PERQ-2 is rather different than the old IOB.  Have quite a
    bit of work to do before we can start building virtual PERQ-2 machines
    but there's a pinprick of light at the end of that long dark tunnel. :-)

    2. Amazingly, with all of my ham-fisted shenanigans over the last month,
    it still builds and runs!  Getting ~ 32fps pretty consistently on my
    old Mac now, and really hope that moving the bulk of the CPU onto its
    own thread will finally get me closer to 170ns/60fps emulation (on my
    "old" hardware).  Then I can drop in the rate-limiting stuff for those
    of you with hardware built in the last decade, where it should really fly.


December, 2021 update:

    1. The PERQ now runs on its own thread, and some "improvements" to speed
    up video have been removed, because apparently writing worse code somehow
    makes it go faster.  Sure.  Removing the 1bpp to 32bpp translation loop
    adds 10-12fps (shaves 80-90ns off the average microcycle time) so there
    has to be a way to speed that up and/or move it off the CPU thread that
    isn't too horrible.  Although doing it in the most idiotic way possible
    will probably make it go even faster, so I need to clearly bash myself
    over the head with a shovel and snort a fifth of Chivas Regal before
    coding that up.  Maybe throw in some GOTOs and really make it fly.

    All of the documentation clearly needs to be rewritten.  More to come.


Holy crap it's January, 2022:

    1. PERQmedia is a new unified storage object complete with a new common
    file format for storing PERQ hard disk, floppy and even tape images.  It
    works with all the old formats, but removes ALL of the file reading and
    writing grunge from the Emulator proper.  Included as a shared subproject
    here, it is also used by PERQdisk (a POS filesystem interrogator and file
    extractor) and will soon/eventually be integrated into PERQfloppy (RT-11
    floppy utility) and Stut (which reads PERQ "STUT" QIC tapes).  Bunch o'
    docs included in the PERQmedia project folder.

    2. The first two storage devices have been converted to work with the new
    PERQmedia StorageDevice class.  Now Shugart SA4000-series hard drives and
    the SA851 floppy drive are split in half:  the "mechanical" operation and
    block-level access to the data are in HardDisk and FloppyDisk classes,
    while the ShugartDiskController and NECuPD765 (floppy disk controller)
    provide the register-level interface to the PERQ and Z80 respectively.

    3. Disk access is actually frighteningly realistic now.  The Z80 CTC,
    HardDiskSeekControl and Scheduler classes were all updated to allow the
    actual Z80 ROM code to drive the emulated disk drive using "buffered"
    seeks.  To be truly perverse, PERQemu will even mimic the startup delay
    of each drive type -- but after the first time you wait 90 actual seconds
    for a simulated disk to "spin up" you'll want to turn off that option too.
    :-)

    4. An extensible database of supported media types is loaded at runtime
    so the groundwork is there to allow all of the PERQ-2 disk types to be
    created, formatted and mounted.  Soon...

    5. There is a ton of work to do to make the new threading approach more
    robust, and completely rethink the way the main application loop works.
    While I flirted with 40-42fps performance in AoT/optimized Release mode
    builds, having to introduce locking in the Scheduler was a hit; still,
    my old Mac is consistently running at 37fps, up from ~30fps in the old
    WinForms version.  Yes, it has to go much, much faster.  Or you can try
    it on a machine that's less than a decade old.


February, 2022:

    Lots of stuff in progress.  The goal is to get the restructured Emulator
    at least back to the level of stability as the current master branch
    before attempting to sync "experiments" back up.  Lots of plumbing to do.
    GPIB/Tablet support is a big hurdle since older OSes require the BitPad;
    working out all the kinks in the ExecutionController so that virtual
    machines can be reliably and accurately managed is top priority.  Adding
    the CIO option (executing the new Z80 code from an actual ROM dump) gives
    us the ability to finally let PERQ-1s run all the newer OSes and software!

    PERQ-2 support will then follow, gracefully and effortlessly.  bwaaaahahahahahahaha no stop it hahahaha sigh.

    1. Worked the Debugger and :var syntax back in, and integrated it with the
    new CLI.  Still some work to do to make it more friendly - like adding tab
    completion on the variable list?  Additional items on the to-do list for
    the CLI are to add global commands, pathname expansion, and a more dynamic
    way to expand the parse tree so that certain string variables can be used
    like enumerated types but updated at runtime).

    2. Hard and floppy disk support is stable again, and feeling more solid.
    May have to implement the Shugart seek ramp timing to match the Z80's
    crazy built-in timing scheme to avoid the occasional disk timeout (but
    they are mostly evident on my slow machine, are not fatal, and just add
    the authenticity of the PERQ experience!).

    3. GPIB controller and bus rewritten to work with the new Z80, and the
    BitPadOne tablet is working again.  A few rough edges and debugging to do.
    (The Kriz tablet is much more efficient but to run Accent S4 or POS F.0 or
    older OSes the BitPad is required.)

    4. All of the hard/floppy disk loading, unloading and saving commands are
    being cleaned up and revamped to work with the new storage architecture.
    A simple search path is implemented to save typing -- "load foo" will look
    for foo, Disks/foo, or apply various file known filename extensions.  New
    commands to create blank disks or even describe the geometry and specs for
    entirely new types of drives are included for advanced users.

    5. Configurations are now loaded from the Conf/ directory, and a number of
    "prefab" systems are included there.  Similar path rules apply so that
    "configure load foo" will find Conf/foo.cfg.  You can assign media files
    to disk drives and save them in the configuration so that the config can
    be loaded and run directly.  In addition, the "preferences" file will
    remember the last configuration you ran and load that by default the next
    time you start PERQemu.

    6. Believe it or not, this Readme has been trimmed substantially to create
    a new UserGuide.  This wad of verbiage will be eventually pruned, rolled
    into a history/change log...

    7. You can now set a preference to turn off the system default arrow cursor
    or change it to a smaller crosshairs cursor when in the Display window.
    Not every change has to be Earth shattering, y'know?

    8. Floppy updates: Write protected floppies are now write protected; status
    change polling implemented; fixed a stooopid bug in the PRQM formatter that
    broke CRCs; testing and refactoring of floppy formatting and debugging why
    writes are failing.  Update: writes were working but the PERQ<->Z80 FIFOs
    and Z80 DMA were/are randomly injecting nulls and corrupting the floppy data.
    It's going to get worse before it gets better.  Or it'll just get worse, full
    stop.  Entropy wins again.


March, 2022:

    1. No good deed goes unpunished.  Having almost nailed down an accurate and
    reliable replacement for the old PERQ<->Z80 FIFOs, it is becoming clear
    that the song and dance necessary to work around the extreme fragility of
    the Z80 code requires that I back that all out and put in at least a short
    queue to allow the Z80 to run properly during the boot phase.  The pre-boot
    environment (SYSB) is so absurdly specific in its requirements that even
    the slightest perturbation of the expected output from the Z80 derails the
    entire process. [Update below]

    2. Debug logging to files added.  Now you can fill up your hard disk with
    frightening rapidity with debug output.  Creates the Output/ directory if
    not already present, and rotates through up to 100 files of 10MB each (for
    now, hardcoded but in future probably tunable through user settings).  Can
    specify one "severity" level for logging to the console and another for the
    file logs and enable/disable them separately.

    3. Reworking the FDC, continued.  The old Z80 code is a complete train wreck
    and the difference between the IOB and the EIO is night and day.  Currently
    the debugging effort is like nailing jelly to a tree; tracing execution of
    Z80 assembler line by line shows that the initialization process seems to be
    completely non-deterministic.  To try to bring some measure of sanity to the
    process, the Z80 is not rate-limited by its own heartbeat timer, and instead
    now tracks the PERQ's Scheduler in a sort of "cooperative threading" model;
    the Z80 only executes an instruction when it falls behind the PERQ CPU, and
    spins when it's ahead (lacking a "nanosleep()" it's real ugly right now, but
    it's accurate).  Since the whole emulated machine now runs in "virtual time"
    the 2.4:1 ratio (1.48:1 for the EIO) of execution speeds is maintained, and
    if the host can run the main processor at full speed the Z80 (and display)
    will automatically be regulated as well.  That'll be the day...

    4. FINALLY tracked down the data corruption issue: the old Z80 ROM uses the
    "INIR" instruction to do block transfers from the PERQ with interrupts off;
    turns out the hardware does provide a signal to pull the Z80 WAIT line low
    so that reads from the PERQR register block.  This blocking behavior is now
    incorporated into the Z80's execution loop; thus, when processing variable-
    length messages from the PERQ using INIR the risk of overrunning the latch
    and getting back zeros is eliminated.  This fixes: data corruption during
    floppy sector transfers, keyboard and tablet enable/disable messages being
    munged, and the problem of the boot character being ignored!  There are
    STILL difficulties around getting the FDC to give back responses that the
    POS FLOPPY program will accept when the media is ejected -- but at least now
    files can be reliably read and written.  Double density works too!

    5. Now that we can actually invoke alternate boots again, the GPIB tablet
    has been verified to work with POS D.6, POS F.*, MPOS E.29, Accent S4 and
    PNX 1.x.  A fix to GPIB protocol handling in the TMS9914 corrected the bug
    where the pointer was jammed up against the left edge of the display; again,
    POS ignored the errant behavior but Accent got tripped up by it, evoking a
    mild flashback to The Great Comma Incident of 2018. <shudder>

    The Kriz tablet works again too.  It wasn't being enabled.  Oops.

    6. Debugging continues.  There are a number of annoyances and corner cases
    that will require more digging; the intractable POS Floppy "misfeature" is
    unsolved.  For now, don't attempt to access the floppy if there's no media
    in the drive or it will hang until you load a file.  Setting the FDC status
    bits that lets the Pascal code avoid these hangs confuses the Z80, but NOT
    setting the bits lets the Z80 execute without complaint but screws up the
    OS and higher layers.  I am throwing my hands up on this one after days of
    fruitless struggle to move on to other things.

    So while the emulator seems stable again, the execution controls are a
    flimsy wreck and performance is steadily getting WORSE (so my quest to
    actually invert the flow of time is proceeding apace!).  Typical frame
    rates are now around 21-22fps.  What can I say?  It's a talent.
    
    7. Starting to reintegrate the RS232 port(s).  Added configuration and
    settings commands for mapping a host device to the serial port(s) so both
    "real" ports (almost always a USB->serial adapter, these days) or the RSX:
    pseudo-device may be attached.  Have to rewrite the old interface to work
    with the new Z80/SIO, however.

    8. Refactoring to add in CIO and Micropolis 8" hard disk support.  Also
    reworked the Z80 rate limiting to let the thread "breathe" a bit; average
    frame rate jumped back to ~30fps.  Huh.

    9. Some UI improvements: the "commands" output that went missing after the
    command tree/CLI was restructured has been restored.  Some small changes to
    the storage commands.  And the PERQmedia library now uses the logger instead
    of naked writes to the console.  Taking a breather/gathering strength for
    the ExecutionController rewrite...

    10. Updated the PROM directory for CIO support: new CPU boot microcode and
    the Z80 code dumped from the v10.17 PROMs.  Updated Z80 DMA to return status
    info and am filling in the missing/changed parts that IOB doesn't use but
    CIO needs.  Fixes to PERQmedia to make IMD-format floppy loading reliable
    (was having issues with bootable POS floppies).  Work proceeding on the new
    User's Guide (in PDF, text update to follow).

    11. Emulator is running the new Z80 and CPU boot ROM code but is not yet
    able to load VFY/SYSB to attempt booting.  Still, it's our first step into
    a larger world...


April, 2022:

    1. Reorganized the CPU and Z80 ROMs a bit, since there were more variations
    than realized.  Have ripped PB, SC, SD, MC and TC variants of the boot ROMs
    and have v8.7 and v10.17 Z80 code.  Only the 24-bit set remains to be ripped
    though full support for the T4 is a ways off.

    2. Becoming evident that the CIO hardware and firmware changes -- ALL of
    which are completely undocumented -- were more extensive and incompatible
    with the original IOB than previously believed.  Tracing microinstruction
    AND Z80 opcode execution manually, line by line, to reverse engineer the
    changes is proving to be painstakingly slow and hugely frustrating.  THREE
    versions of the boot ROMs, NONE of which agree, all of which hang or fail
    in completely unique ways.  Sigh.

    3. First successful floppy boot with CIO:  PNX 2.  Huh?  POS still hangs and
    fails, but the OS I have _zero_ source code for stumbles across the finish
    line.  Proves the actual PROM code works, so I got that goin' for me.

    4. First successful hard disk boot with CIO:  POS G.7!  Have been able to
    complete an install of Accent S6 but it will not boot from the hard disk;
    some really obscure differences between the IOB and CIO are proving rather
    difficult to track down, and ROM+microcode bugs and incongruities aren't
    helping.  Kriz tablet not working on CIO due to unknown SIO/Z80 issue.

    5. To aid debugging, can now switch Qcode sets in the debugger, and decode/
    display 2-byte opcode sequences.  The older POS/Accent "V4" set is still the
    default; Accent "V5" codes now available for Accent S6 and beyond.  Will add
    PNX C-codes if/when any kind of source or description of them is found.


May, 2022:

    1. Still plugging away, slowly.  "Real life" and mundane crap like "mortgage
    payments" are a bloody distraction from what actually matters: continuing to
    improve the emulation of a machine nobody remembers for an audience that
    numbers in the single digits while the world burns down around us.  La la la
    so I'm adding breakpoint support and fixing bugs while staring bleary eyed
    at millions of lines of instruction traces trying to pinpoint why Accent S6
    won't boot; in the meantime, POS G.7 runs beautifully, so a first cut of a
    POS G hard disk image (with Accent S6 loaded) that runs on "CIO" included!
    Draft of the user's guide is coming along as well.

    2. Improving breakpoint support. The point is to supplement the logging with
    the ability to pause emulation, run a script, and more accurately pinpoint
    specific conditions helpful to debugging the reeeeally esoteric bugs.  Also
    adding commands to print and save command history, to aid in creating debug
    scripts that can be executed when a breakpoint fires.  The best example is
    to leave tracing turned off during the initial boot/Vfy/SysB steps, then
    automatically pause emulation and enable highly detailed logging only when
    a specific microinstruction is executed.  The issue with Accent not booting
    on CIO will likely be headslappingly obvious once it's found...

    3. Stumped.  Either Accent is relying on some correct, expected hardware
    behavior that we don't properly emulate, or it's relying on a quirk or bug
    that ISN'T there because we are emulating the hardware as documented.  At
    startup it appears that the kernel initializes, jumps to the Pascal QCode
    interpreter, starts executing then ends up looping in the microscheduler --
    is it failing to swap in a code segment (hard disk or Z80 issue?) or is
    there a more subtle glitch that is special to Accent and not POS?  MulDiv?
    Video interrupt behavior?  (Anyone suggesting Mercury in retrograde will be
    slapped about the head and neck.  But right now, actually, that seems as
    valid a reason as any.  Sigh.)


June, 2022: 

    1. AHA!  Found the needle, now just have to extricate myself from this huge
    haystack... full of needles, red herring, blind alleys, McGuffins, wild geese
    and all manner of cliches.  Ugh.  [TIME PASSES]  So Accent now boots and
    two-byte extended ops work correctly now; fixed a very obscure bug in micro-
    address generation that's been there forever.  Now, however, we're back to
    Z80 initialization issues; Accent completes its memory sizing loop and sets
    up a bunch of memory management structures, then hangs waiting for the Z80
    to initialize.  Problem with self-modifying code?  SIO/IRQ issue causing the
    Z80 startup to loop/fail?  Yay.  Another fun one.

    In other news; PNX 2 still can't poke at the hard disk, so clearly the CIO
    Z80 still needs some lovin'.  I've patched the boot ROM file to correct what
    I consider a microcode bug that causes CIO boots to hang at DDS 010.  The
    "debug clear interrupt z80datain" workaround is no longer necessary.

    2. Awwww, man, I am >this< close... there is clearly something extremely
    specific to the CIO and/or 16K CPU that Accent S5/S6 relies on behaving a
    little bit differently than POS G does, and it's driving me nuts.  With 256K
    of memory configured, S6 seems to successfully start up the Z80 and even
    appears to be running a few RasterOps (so, starting to clear the screen and
    paint characters) but it never properly kicks off the video display list to
    make it visible.  With 512K-2MB of memory, it loops forever running the
    initialization routines and never gets to the Z80 startup.  Though I have
    verified that we are able to jump into high banks to run extended two-byte
    opcodes and properly return to bank 0, I'm guessing there's still some tiny
    little glitch in the sequencer (best guess) or extended call stack (two bit
    kluge) that might explain the behavior... The bleary-eyed search continues.

    3. Second Accent boot bug resolved: the multiply/divide unit was giving back
    bogus results.  Many of the 16K CPU's features weren't incorporated into POS
    directly, but Accent S6 uses them (since support for the 4K CPU was dropped
    after S4?).  Now the boot completes and Accent starts the window manager,
    tracks the mouse, then hard hangs during Process Manager initialization in
    what's likely an I/O or Z80-related issue (execution continues in a tight
    loop and Accent hard hangs, but the emulator doesn't crash).  Funny how my
    idle speculations in previous entries pointed right at the problem but I
    didn't actually see it until I stepped on it like a cartoon rake to the face.

    4.  Found and corrected an extremely subtle issue with how BPC assignment
    affects incrementing the counter, but it seems like it doesn't affect normal
    operations.  That's pretty subtle, I guess.  Also found an actual bug in the
    PNX 2.0 16K boot floppy version of VFY, which is not easily fixed or worked
    around.  Still hoping to get a PNX 2 hard disk install using the 4K CPU, but
    the primary focus is digging through 2.9GB of traces (51M lines in 295 log
    files) looking for the reason Accent hangs as it brings up Process Manager.

    5.  Accent has regressed; the Mul/Div unit fix was just a happy accident
    that allowed the boot to progress!  Fixing it to produce the correct result
    has set us back.  Color me confused.  I have tested the landscape display
    option, however, and the "g7.prqm" disk image now contains an "l" boot to
    try it out.  Configure a PERQ-1A with landscape and CIO, then assign the
    "g7" disk and bootchar l (lower case L).  Looks amazing on a Cinema (or
    1080p) display.  Use the default "a" boot with the portrait.  Accent S6 is
    "z" boot, or will be once the bug preventing initialization is fixed!

    6.  Added Unix/Emacs-style control characters to the command line editor,
    so I can finally just type ^U instead of hitting ESC to erase the line.
    More little tweaks/fixes/debugging but still the insanely picayune detail
    that is preventing Accent boot eludes me.


July, 2022:

    1.  Accent S6 runs now.
