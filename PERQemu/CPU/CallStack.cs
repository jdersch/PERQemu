    /// <summary>
    /// Represents a 16k CPU call stack, which on a real PERQ is implemented as an
    /// AMD 2901's stack and some external glue for the top 2 bits (literally, the
    /// "two bit kluge").  The top two bits are independent and are not affected by
    /// overflow from the lower 12 bits; this class manages that logic.
    ///
    /// </summary>

    /// Implementation note:
    /// The Am2910 documentation (Am2900 Family Data Book, pg 2-136) clearly states
    /// the behavior of the 2910's internal stack:  The pointer does NOT wrap.  When
    /// the stack pointer is reset to zero, the contents are undefined until a PUSH
    /// occurs; accordingly, any POP when the stack is empty is an undefined result.
    /// When the FULL condition is reached, a sixth PUSH overwrites the top word.
    /// Curiously, the FULL pin on the 2910 is not connected in the PERQ CPU (though
    /// it could have been wired to an unused bit in the microstate register?) so
    /// there is no way to know when you've exceeded the maximum stack depth!
    ///
    /// I've slightly tweaked Josh's original implementation to more accurately reflect
    /// the Am2910 documentation.  The stack is now an array [1..5] instead of [0..4],
    /// and the two stack pointers always point to the current top.  This fixes the a
    /// somewhat obscure case where TopLo() would attempt to read beyond the end of the
    /// array and barf.
    ///
    /// PERQ quirk: it appears that Boot or VFY is leaking a push... but SYSB clears
    /// the stack before entering the interpreter.
