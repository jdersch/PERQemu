PERQ I/O Board Implemetation Notes
==================================

Every PERQ has a 5-slot backplane, which requires at minimum a CPU board, a
memory board, and an IO board.  The two extra slots, labeled CPU Option and
IO Option, can be fitted with several different boards.  This file describes
which of these options are supported by PERQemu.

PERQ_Chart.jpg shows which configurations we aim to support with PERQemu.

Confusion
---------

The PERQ-1 I/O Board is typically referred to as "IOB".  In practice this
means it contains a Z80 subsystem with one RS-232 port, GPIB, audio output
channel, DMA hardware, and controllers for the Shugart floppy and hard disk
drives.  The IOB Z80 runs at ~2.5Mhz and typically runs firmware version
v8.7 (which is what simulated Z80 in the earlier versions of PERQemu was
designed to mimic).  This version of the firmware is known as the "old Z80"
protocol.

The PERQ-2 series contains an updated board called the "EIO", or "Ethernet
IO" board.  It features a faster Z80 @ 4Mhz, an additional RS-232 port, an
RTC chip, and a newer disk interface that supports 8" Micropolis or 5.25"
ST-506/MFM type drives.  An version of the EIO board without the Ethernet
controller, called the "NIO" board, was available as an option but how many
of these were ever shipped is unclear;  I've never even seen one, but they
are mentioned in various places including "PERQ_Chart.jpg" (included in the
Docs directory).  The latest/most common version of the Z80 firmware is
v10.017 (or thereabouts), which is known as the "new Z80".

There is some confusion about what the "CIO" board is.  With later versions
of POS, PNX and Accent, the "old Z80" protocols were dropped as the "new Z80"
code is supposed to be faster, better maintained, and supports all of the
new EIO/NIO features.  In order to not leave the installed base of PERQ-1s
behind, firmware updates were made available so that the original IOBs could
run the v10.x code, thus the old IOB with new firmware was called "current",
or "CIO".  That's the theory, anyway.

Microcode sources exist that imply that there was at least one subtle hardware
and microcode change that would allow the CIO board to support the Micropolis
hard disk, and some hint that perhaps ICL may have built a version of the PERQ-1
configured this way!  [Update: there is now photographic evidence of an ICL-
labeled CIO board to confirm this!]  Note that The Chart doesn't officially
list the CIO as a hardware option.


Options!
--------

There are no known dedicated CPU Option boards in the wild.  Rumors and even
press clippings report that a "cache/pager board" was supposedly being readied
(sometimes called the "pager box" as far back as March, '81) but there's no
evidence that it ever shipped -- no schematics, notes, or code has been found
to show it was ever completed, and only a few undocumented signal lines on the
backplane hint at what it might have contained.  The only boards known to work
in the CPU Option slot are the "link board", used for microcode debugging, and
the "universal streamer board," a wire-wrapped QIC tape drive interface.

There are quite a few interesting IO Option boards, but most of them are
extremely rare.  PERQ was one of the early adopters of Ethernet, and many
early PERQ-1s at Carnegie-Mellon University had wire-wrapped 3Mbit "prototype
Ethernet" boards.  At least one physical example of this board still exists,
and there is software support for it.  Adding emulation support to PERQemu
for 3Mbit Ethernet would be _especially_ fun if it could then talk to an
emulated Xerox Alto (see: Josh Dersch's amazing "Contralto" project).

The PERQ Audre scanner board is a full-slot IO Option that provides a large
memory buffer and hookup to a CCD camera mounted to a light rack and used for
scanning and image processing.  These are super cool and would be really fun
to mess with - we even have some code to drive one.  But it's likely there
are no more real ones out there in the world anymore.  Which _sucks_.

Three Rivers did produce a "Multibus/Laser Option" board, of which a few
surviving examples still exist.  There is software support available as well.
While documentation has turned up that shows development on this started much
earlier than previously believed, and that initial development had been done
on a PERQ-1, all of the surviving microcode seems to require the EIO board's
DMA for data transfer.  So if/when we are able to add the "MLO" board, it'll
be restricted to the PERQ-2/EIO configurations.  This board supports either
one controller board plugged in directly [one physical example of this board
is confirmed to exist!] OR it is cabled to an external card cage.  Microcode
and Pascal support for driving either an SMD disk controller or a 9-track tape
drive exists; for tape support we'll need to add the Ciprico Tapemaster board,
but there's no information about what specific Multibus SMD disk controller
cards that this software talkes to.  The idea of hanging a string of CDC 9766
300MB drives off a PERQ is enticing.  Anyone have a clue?  Anyone?  Bueller?


By far the most common IO option is Three Rivers' "OIO" board.  The basic
"Option IO" Board comes in many flavors: it may contain the "link" option, a
10Mbit Ethernet controller, a QIC streamer controller, and the Canon laser
printer interface.  The "link" option is a DEC-compatible 16-bit parallel
interface, originally used to bootstrap the earliest PERQ from a PDP-11; later
it was used to allow one PERQ to debug microcode on another one using tools
like ODTPRQ or PDM.  It is also used to connect the Metheus color graphics
subsystem (which we don't have plans to emulate anytime soon).

The "EthCan" board can be used to turn the PERQ-1 into a network print server,
allowing users to send screen dumps or documents across the Ethernet to a
dedicated PERQ for output on the Canon LBP-10 (or later) LBP-CX printers.
The fully-loaded "EthCanTape" adds tape backup through an Archive Sidewinder
30MB cartridge tape drive.  These were both popular OIO variants.  All of the
OIO options will hopefully be included in PERQemu someday.

While the Link and QIC Tape can be fitted in the CPU Option slot, for emulation
purposes we'll just lump them all onto one virtual board.  There is limited
support for the Link board in PERQemu; Ethernet and Canon printing are the most
interesting options to add next.  The Streamer option was introduced in v0.4.8.

Note that because the EIO board has a similar-but-not-quite-identical built-in
Ethernet as the controller on the OIO, there appear to be hardware port and DMA
channel conflicts that prevent dual-homed PERQs.  It was possible to put a 3Mbit
board into an EIO-equipped PERQ-2 to build a 3-to-10 bridge node [Josh HAS one
of these now], but this was almost certainly not a standard/shipping config and
was only used at CMU.  It is unlikely that PERQemu will ever support more than
one Ethernet in one virtual machine, but it would be pretty cool.


What PERQemu Supports (or will, I hope)
---------------------------------------

The "real Z80" allows us to faithfully emulate all of the PERQ models and any
version of the firmware we can lay our hands upon.  The EIO hardware allows
Z80 code to be loaded into its private RAM at boot time, patching or extending
the ROM functionality, so we can't "fake it" with a simulation that just spoofs
the protocol used.  So now the IO board instantiates a Z80 and feeds it actual
ROM images based on the selected configuration.

IOBoard.cs provides a base class from which all of the IO boards can be
derived.  From the hardware standpoint, the basic functionality (connection
to the IO bus on the backplane) is the same; only the particulars of the Z80
and the type of hard disk interface are different:

    IOB.cs  - supports the PERQ-1 chassis only, with the standard list of
              peripherals described above.  The Z80 runs at 2.4576Mhz,
              v8.7 firmware ("old" Z80).  The hard disk controller 
              supports one Shugart drive only.
              
              Note that PERQemu's IOB supports the Kriz tablet, though that
              was actually extremely rare on the PERQ-1.

    CIO.cs  - for the PERQ-1, same as the IOB but loads the v10.017 Z80 ROM
              so you can run the latest OS versions.  May allow one Micropolis
              8" drive to be selected instead of the Shugart?

    EIO.cs  - for all PERQ-2 systems, supports the standard interfaces listed
              above.  The Z80 @ 4Mhz runs v10.017 firmware ("new" Z80).

              In the early (rare) PERQ-2 (K1? T0?) chassis, I think there's
              only physical space for one 8" Micropolis hard drive [Josh can
              confirm this].  In the ICL-designed T1 chassis, one or two 8"
              disks are possible.  In the T2 or 24-bit T4, the disk controller
              supports one or two 5.25" MFM disks.  The same emulated EIO will
              support 20- or 24-bit configurations by loading the slightly
              different ROM; there's no need to build a separate 24-bit EIO.

    NIO.cs  - wherever the EIO can go, the NIO is there without the network
              interface.  Until we actually write the emulation of the
              Ethernet and hook it up to an interface on the host, all of
              the EIOs are essentially NIOs. :-)

IOBoard.cs runs the Z80System on its own thread.  That's really the one feature
that separates it from the Option IO boards; we may just cheat and define the
OptionIO boards as IOBoards where Z80System is null, or OptionBoard.cs will be
the base class for the Ether3Mbit, OIO and MLO boards.  May be a long time
comin' before we get any of those written...

The Ethernet driver will likely be split in half:  the PERQ emulation of its
fully-custom TTL implementation and homegrown microcode interface will run
on the CPU thread, while the actual host-side packet handling will run on a
background thread as it does in Contralto/Darkstar?


[edit: duplicated/too verbose/brought over from IOBoards.txt]


Optional Boards Not Likely To Be Added
--------------------------------------

The Audre board was a wicked cool CCD camera interface.  The software still
exists.  If anyone, anywhere in the world still has working boards or any
kind of schematics or hardware documentation... not holding my breath.

Metheus color display controllers could theoretically be emulated and attached
through the Link board.  Software drivers for the PERQ exist.  Not planned.


Due to microcode and hardware conflicts, it does not appear possible to run a
PERQ-2 EIO with an OIO Ethernet option board.  While the T2 cabinet has both
OSLAN A & B ports (ICL's branding of Ethernet?) there's no standard software
support for it.  When Ethernet is implemented, PERQemu will only support one
interface [and for simplicity, it may be "attached" to the IO Option board
slot but will use the appropriate IO registers to appear as an EIO or OIO
depending on the Chassis selection].



This is a whole lot of typing that nobody else will read or care about...
